## Abstract

The main objective of this project is to develop an **AI-based system capable of generating real-time, realistic football commentary**.  
The system will process live match data and automatically detect important actions‚Äîsuch as goals, passes, fouls, and substitutions‚Äîthrough intelligent computer vision and data analysis. It will then generate **natural, broadcaster-style commentary**, enriched with tactical insights and contextual details about players, teams, and tournaments.  

By combining **data-driven action recognition** with **natural language generation**, the system recreates the experience of professional commentary even without live visuals‚Äîallowing fans to follow matches interactively and immersively.

## Problem Statement & Motivation

Many football fans miss live matches due to broadcasting restrictions, time differences, or limited access. This results in a lack of engagement and real-time connection to their favorite teams.  

This project aims to address that gap by developing an **AI-powered commentary system** that can replicate the excitement and insight of live sports broadcasting. The system provides **automatic, human-like narration and analysis** of football matches, bringing fans closer to the game while also offering a valuable tool for broadcasters and analysts.

## Proposed Solution

The system identifies and evaluates football match events and generates descriptive, human-like commentary using AI-based models for **action recognition** and **language generation**.

### **Key Features**
- **Automated Action Recognition:** Detect and analyze match events in real time using data feeds or video input.  
- **Natural Language & Audio Commentary:** Produce fluent, professional-quality text and speech commentary.  
- **Analytical & Tactical Insights:** Add interpretive notes and strategic context for richer analysis.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Deliver commentary via an intuitive web interface for live or replayed matches.  

---

## Project Scope

The system focuses on **football (soccer)** and aims to detect and describe major in-game actions to simulate a live commentary experience.

### **In Scope**
- Action & motion detection  
- Event categorization (e.g., goal, pass, foul, substitution)  
- Automated text description generation  
- Contextual player and team data integration  
- Simple web-based user interface  

### **Possible Features**
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) audio commentary  
- Real-time data integration via APIs  
- Multi-language commentary support  
- Tactical and performance insights  

### **Out of Scope**
- Live streaming or visual broadcasting  
- Human-written or post-edited commentary  
- Support for non-football sports  
- Historical analytics or long-term data storage  

### **Assumptions & Limitations**
- Relies on structured match data or recorded footage.  
- Commentary accuracy depends on event detection reliability.  
- Prototype focuses on proof of concept, not full scalability.
